1.  Create VM Directory.
    
    a.  Create first blank image ( with thin provisioning )
        qemu-img create -f qcow2 test.img 50g  // This will create 50 GB image 
        
    b. Use this image to Install OS  ( For Ubuntu install as OEM Install only )
    
    c. Update OS + Applications +  Once everything  looks okay,  run sysprep utility and shut down the VM.  This will allow 
       to ask for new username and password etc for further VM's.
        
    d. Delete the VM without deleting the storage 
    
       Rename the test.img  to os_plus_application_base.template
       
       Make it readonly.  
    
    d. Create linked images from the images.
    
    e. Create VM's  from newsly created images.
    qemu-img create -f qcow2 -b os_plus_application_base.template  vm1.img
    
    Furher you can create links and use those links while creating VM.  So when accidently VM is deleted only links will 
    will be delated and not actil disk file.  
    
    Very Important :
    ================
    
    To merge child vm with its backing file  please run following command.
    
    qemu-img convert -f qcow2  name-of-child.img  -O qcow2 new-image.img   (  You will not need backing file name etc, it will find on its own. ) 
    
    
    Once the windows vm is ready with all updates and applications,  you will need to run sysprep utility ( Loation c:\windows\system32\syspre\)
    
    For Linux you will need to install virt-sysprep
    Example... 
    
    virt-sysprep -a childvm.img  --hostname examplehost  --root-password password:123456
    
    
    
    Notes :
    ========
    qemu-img info vm1.img     //  This will show the backing file ( which template is used )
    
    Image Conversions :
    =====================
    
    VMDK to Raw --->.
    qemu-img convert -f vmdk -O raw image.vmdk image.img
    
    VMDK to qcow2  --->
    qemu-img convert -f vmdk -O qcow2 image.vmdk image.qcow2
    
    VDI  to  qcow2 ---->
    qemu-img convert -f vdi -O qcow2 vm.vdi vm.qcow2
