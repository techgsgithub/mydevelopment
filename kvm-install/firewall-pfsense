##  This is a procedure for providing inbuilt firewall for kvm host ##
##  Recommeded firewall for usage is pfsense  ##

Procedure :

1.  Create isolated bridge from cli only.  (  Do not use any virt-manager )

      a.  Create XML File  with following code 
       
       <network> <name>privatenet</name> <bridge name="privatebr0" /> </network>
       
      b.  Create a bridge from the command line
      
        virsh net-define privatenet.xml
        
      c.  Start the bridge.
      
        net-start privatenet
        
      d.  Set it as auto-start bridge.
      
        net-autostart privatenet
        
        
2.   Now Install PfSense from its iso file and set the VM as autostart( Recommended for SERVER Installation only )
     
     The VM will require  two Virtual Lan Cards or more.
     
     WAN SIDE  ->>>>  Bridge br0: Host Device.
     
     LAN SIDE  ->>>>  Virtual Network created Earlier.
     
     Additional Lan Cards for setting  VPN and other stuff.
     
     
     On all Further VM's  use Virtual Network Card only.
     
     This will help to provide firewall services to ALL VM's inside the kvm.
     

3.  Notes : A. PFsense by default, will not ping from outside ( wan address ) .  You need to  allow icmp package allow from VM.
            B. You need to nat with port required for your next vms.
            c. To manage the pfsense from hostside network  --- switch to https protocall  --  provide 444 as port number --  Pass rule 
               to allow port 444 to lan address.
