How to take auto-backup of Pfsense Firewall on a Linux Host.

Process :
1.  Setup standard pfsense firewall  as usual 
2.  Enable ssh login to non-standard port something like 2226  ( you can choose your convenient port )


On Ubuntu host:  [IP  10.0.100.1 my username is :  administrator  & I am a sudo user ]
 
[  All Commands listed here are to be typed in Terminal ]

Step 1.  Create pair of ssh keys 

ssh-keygen  -t rsa

Step 2 :  Transfer the public key to your pfsense box. 

ssh-copy-id -p 2226  root@10.0.0.1

Step 3 :  Create a directory called Firewall  

mkdir Firewall
cd Firewall

Step 4 :  Create a file called fwbackup.sh

nano fwbackup.sh

Step 5 :  Enter following Text  & save the file.
###  Start File
cd
cd /home/administrator/Firewall
timestamp=$(date +%d-%B-%Y-%HHrs-%MMins-%SSeconds)
f=config.xml
scp -P 2226 root@10.0.0.1:/conf/config.xml /home/administrator/Firewall/config.xml
cp -a "$f" "$f-$timestamp"
cd 
###  End of File

Step 6 :  Create automation using crontab [  In my case , I require pfsense backup to happen everyday @ 10 pm .

crontab -e 
//  at the end of the file type following text  //
0 22 * * 0  sh  /home/administrator/Firewall/fwbackup.sh

Conclusion :  You have config.xml of your pfsense box of every day.  In case of crash or you can restore your firewall without any issue + you will have all the files ( day to day ).  So can revert to any date in the past.
